## Release... the Kraken!

<p>Kraken is an easy to use, powerful and fast Android bitmaps and data caching framework, based and refactored from my original open source <b>droid_utils</b> @Luluvise (which can be found at https://github.com/Luluvise/droid-utils).
</p>

### Bitmap loading and caching
TODO

### POJO and DTO loading, (de)serialization and caching
TODO

### Coming soon
* Gradle integration
* Bitmaps: save into caches a resampled/resized version of a bitmap
* Bitmaps: allow custom pre/post processing of the downloaded bitmap
* Allow selection and use of other disk/memory cache policies (LFU?)
* Effective automatic disk cache purge policy implementation

### Alternatives to Kraken
<p>There are many other valid (and well known) open source alternatives to Kraken, which may be more suitable for you. Here is a few ones:
<ul>
<li><b>Volley</b> (https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/325304728)</li>
<li><b>Picasso</b> (http://square.github.io/picasso/)</li>
<li><b>Universal Image Loader</b> (https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader)</li>
</ul>
